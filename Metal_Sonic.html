<h2> Who Is He? </h2>
<p> However, even though Robotnink could not roboticize Sonic, he did manage to make a dopleganger named Metal Sonic. Metal Sonic was a deadly robot that could defeat Sonic in somee cases. In the games, the development of Metal Sonic allowed players to race against this mysterious dopelganger. Metal's main goal was to suprass Sonic in a race or speed. However Sonic was always able to beat him in the end. Even though Metal Sonic had Sonic's speed, it had it's own special Abilities. Metal Sonic had cettain "sheilds" that would appear when he is in need. The most common one was the burst sheild which was an offensive/defensive shield at the same time. He would also use this when in an attack. Metal Sonic is a cool deadly character that many people enjoy. </p>
