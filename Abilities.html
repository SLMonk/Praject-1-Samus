<h2> The Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald</h2>
<p> The Chaos Emeralds are the most powerful source of energy on the planet. Doctor Eggman constantlyy tries to haul them away from hiding and use them for his evil plans. The Chaos Emeralds grant power to certain Mobians of Mobuis (such as we all know already Sonic has their power) and allows them to go "super." In this state the use is granted huge amounts of Chaos energy which grants them to fly, increase in all of their normal abilities, and the power of Chaos Control. Chaos Control allows the user to have abilities such as to fix timelines that have been broken, and even have the ablity to shoot a giant laser beam at the target.
