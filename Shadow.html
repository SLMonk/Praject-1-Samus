<p> Shadow was created by Dr. Eggman's grandfather, Gerald Robotnik's, who designed Shadow to be the "Ultimate Life Form". However, the government deemed him a threat, and forcefully shuts down the project and killing Robotnik's daughter Maria collaterally while protecting Shadow. Dr. Eggman hopes to use his power for his own goals 50 years later, though upon resuscitation, he wakes he doesnt remeber much exept desires to exact revenge upon the world for Maria's death. However, later in time he learned that before Maria's death she wanted him to protect the world. He stopped his world domination goals and joined forces with Sonic to stop him from ending the world. Shadow the Hedgehog was another charcter that was simmilar to Sonic. People in the game often thought that this was Sonic in his first apperance. Sonic reffered to him as his "Faker" because they look so much alike. Shadow has an ability to warp time and space called Chaos Control. When shadow used Chaos Control it allowed him to teleport to other dimensions, places, or worlds. Shadow had a lot of Chaos power inside him so to keep that controlled he has Inhibitor rings that he wears on his wrists. </p>
